                Hi, my name is Zach Mutch. I&apos;m a graphic designer turned
                front-end developer with a strong focus on front-end. I&apos;m
                passionate about creating visually appealing and user-friendly
                web applications. Drawing from my background in graphic design,
                I bring a unique perspective to translating design concepts into
                responsive web apps. My current obsession is React, and I&apos;m
                dedicated to mastering it. However, I&apos;m a fast learner and
                enjoy the process of acquiring new technologies and tools that
                are best suited for each project&apos;s needs.

                Having recently completed a full-stack web development bootcamp
                at Ohio State University with exceptional scores, I&apos;m eager
                to join a dynamic team where I can further enhance my skills and
                knowledge in font-end web development. While I wait for the
                right opportunity, I have been actively continuing my studies
                online through platforms like Scrimba and freeCodeCamp.
                Additionally, I&apos;ve been taking on various projects to gain
                hands-on experience. I&apos;m deeply committed to continuous
                learning and driven by a passion for creating exceptional web
                applications.

                In my free time, I enjoy participating in various activities.
                Gaming has always been a lifelong interest of mine, not only
                providing entertainment but also allowing me to create
                meaningful connections with people from all over the world.
                Through my involvement in the gaming and esports community, I
                discovered my passion for design and technology. Apart from
                gaming, I love watching TV shows, movies, and anime with my
                wife. These shared experiences create moments of joy and
                excitement that fuel my creativity. Spending time with close
                friends is also a crucial aspect of my life, whether it&apos;s
                playing board games or engaging in outdoor activities.
